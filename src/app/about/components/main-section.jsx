        </h1>
        <p className="text-textPrimary">
          The publication is run by a team of students at Eton College. We aim
          to provide students with a platform to explore their passion for
          sustainability and the environment through the ability to read, write
          and create media for the publication.
          <br />
          <br />
          This issue is one of the most important issues that humanity has ever
          faced and we believe that a deep understanding of how we can solve it
          is necessary.
          <br />
          <br /> We welcome articles throughout the year and update the site
          constantly! Get involved by reaching out with our contact form, or
